# SmartScoutScraper

Smartscout hides the data on the user interface to encourage upgrading plans

However the data is still sent to the browser via the API, edit your session token and identifying information from curl, find the brand ID, and this script will output all sellers(with storefront ID) who currently sell a certain brand

Good for OA or wholesale on AMZ
